  MAX7219/MAX7221
  Maxim MAX7219/MAX7221 Class for Arduino
  Created by Cort Buffington
  July 2012

This class implements several methods for using the MAX72xx family of LED controllers. All methods for display writing (turning LEDs on and off) store the display state in an 8x8 RAM matrix. Some of the methods will update (and display) the entire 8x8 matrix, while some will only "update" parts of it. Hardware SPI is used. The focus of this class is on speed and efficiency. It is limited in that it ONLY addresses the chip(s) in matrix mode, i.e. does not use the onboard 7 segment decoding features.

NOTE: Reducing the Scan Limit value below maximum will mess up the intensity control. The number of items the chip scans is linked to how PWM dimming is implemented. Unless you're really strapped for resources, or don't care about dimming, you'll get the best results by leaving it at 8 (maximum).
